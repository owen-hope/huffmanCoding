# huffmanCoding
Huffman encoding and decoding
This program was developed for a data structures and algorithms master project.

It creates a huffman tree based on a min heap

In order to run complie all the files.
To encode a file: java henc5191 <file path>
This will encode the file with a .huf on the end of it
  
To decode a file with a .huf (this will replace a file if the name of that file already exists): java hdec5191 <file path>
